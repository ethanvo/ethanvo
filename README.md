Hi there, I'm Ethan A. Vo 👋
I am a Ph.D. Theoretical and Computational Chemist based in New York, NY. I specialize in correlated electronic structure theory and atomistic modeling for extended systems, with a focus on developing high-accuracy methods within PySCF.

🔬 Research Focus

My work bridges the gap between software development and advanced chemical physics. I am particularly interested in:

Electronic Structure Theory: Developing and implementing periodic EOM-CCSD methods for high-accuracy predictions of semiconductor band gaps and core-level spectroscopy.

Interfacial Chemistry: Integrating machine-learned force fields and coupled-cluster methods to model catalytic environments and battery interfaces.

💻 Key Contributions & Projects

PySCF Development

Periodic EOM-CCSD: Developed and benchmarked methods for predicting bandgaps of inorganic semiconductors, achieving sub-0.5 eV mean absolute error relative to experiment.

Core-Level Spectroscopy: Implemented all-electron periodic EOM-CCSD calculations to predict K- and L-edge core binding energies in solids, incorporating natural orbital truncation and composite extrapolation.

Finite-Size Correction: Implemented composite correction schemes to obtain converged periodic CCSD results with Gaussian basis sets.

Chronus Quantum (C++)

Relativistic Chemistry: Enhanced the codebase with four-component relativistic electronic structure capabilities for heavy-element systems.

Algorithm Optimization: Developed recursive integral evaluation algorithms to improve numerical stability and performance for many-body interactions.

Battery Interface Modeling

Lithium Metal Surfaces: Designed a cluster-based approach for coupled-cluster calculations to obtain benchmark energetics of ethylene carbonate at battery interfaces.

ML Force Fields: Applied MACE-MPO-based force fields to simulate solvent decomposition dynamics at lithium-metal anode interfaces.
